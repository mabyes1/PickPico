# MCPocket

MCPocket turns an Android phone into a manually controlled MCP execution node.

## Current milestone

- Start and stop a foreground MCP node from the app.
- Serve Streamable HTTP on `http://<phone-ip>:8765/mcp`.
- Authenticate every MCP POST with a per-start bearer token.
- Expose `server_info`, read-only `phone_status`, restricted `phone_exec`, and the observable `phone_echo` action.
- Support the legacy initialize flow and the MCP `2026-07-28` stateless discovery flow.
- Keep MCP protocol/transport separate from Android tool implementations through a tool registry.

`phone_exec` only accepts predefined diagnostic command IDs; it does not accept a shell string or arbitrary arguments.

Arbitrary shell execution, ADB, FYT, Git, SSH, discovery, TLS, and UI polish are not implemented yet.

## Build

The machine-wide developer environment must provide Java 17, Gradle 8.7, and Android SDK 35.

```powershell
cd D:\coding-tools-mcp\MCPocket
gradle :app:assembleDebug
```

Debug APK:

`app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`

## Connect

1. Put the phone and MCP client on the same trusted LAN.
2. Open MCPocket and press **Start node**.
3. Copy the displayed connection JSON into an MCP client that supports custom HTTP headers.
4. List tools, call `server_info`, then call `phone_echo` with `{ "text": "hello phone" }`.

The node rejects requests without its bearer token and rejects non-loopback browser origins.

## ADB development bridge

Debug builds expose a tiny smoke-test bridge protected by Android's `DUMP` permission. Ordinary
third-party apps cannot invoke it, release builds ignore it, and the MCP HTTP authentication path
is unchanged. It exists so local development tools can trigger observable actions without copying
the node credential through terminal arguments.

```powershell
pwsh scripts/phone-find.ps1
pwsh scripts/phone-find.ps1 -DurationSeconds 30
pwsh scripts/phone-find.ps1 -Stop
```
